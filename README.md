# Touch Mapper

Tactile map maker. Creates files for 3D or embossing printing from OpenStreetMap data. See https://touch-mapper.org

## Development

### Install dependencies

    ./init.sh

### Setup AWS CLI

    aws configure

### Create AWS resources

    make dev-aws-install

API Gateway for accessing email sending Lambda is for now not created
automatically. The same API GW endpoints can be used by all Touch Mapper
instances.

### Install static website to S3

    make dev-web-s3-install

Last line of output gives the URL (https://something.cloudfront.net) where
the web UI can be accessed.

### Run OSM -> STL converter service

In a tab of its own:

    install/run-dev-converter.sh

### Local web development

In `web` dir, in separate tabs:

    make watch
    make serve

You can now access the web UI in http://localhost:9000

## Feature roadmap

List is in a rough priority order.

- Allow printing a QR sticker that points to touch-mapper.org/?map=deadbeef
- Allow inspecting maps on a touch device.
  - APH's Nearby Explorer, and other apps
- Describe map contents in the web UI (in progress).
  - Roads: intersections between roads, and between roads and map borders; street numbers
  - Points of interest, esp. bus stops: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places#place_search_requests
  - Support hot-keys for area adjustment, so that choosing the area is practical for a blind user
- Describe map contents in audio
  - Could perhaps crowd source production of the descriptions
- Print labels for roads and/or points of interest
  - Maybe use short labels, and offer a separate legend that maps the labels to longer descriptions. The legend could be electronic.
- Replace spinning 3D preview with one or more larger static images, create using Blender Render, using ambient occlusion
  - 3D preview is too small and unclear, and doesn't work on all devices
- Remember user's past maps
- Avoid significant overlaps between roads and buildings. This would enable reliable two-color 3D printing.
- Print a compass star into corner of the map
- Indicate map scale using small dots on map borders
- Smaller scale modes: only show water/land/green areads; N largest roads; city borders
- Non-square maps
- Indoor areas

Technical TODO:

- Move converter from EC2 to Lambda
- Do all the work in a Java application that could be based on the first stages
  of OSM2World transformation pipeline. Benefits:
  - Do road processing mostly when they are still line segments rather than 2D objects
    - Create embosser input
    - Avoid roads intersecting with buildings => enable two-color 3D printing
      - Maybe use https://sourceforge.net/projects/jts-topo-suite/
    - Much easier to describe map contents (eg. roads intersecting with edges)
  - Better performance
  - Simpler processing pipeline
